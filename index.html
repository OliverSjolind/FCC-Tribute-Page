    <h2>Early life</h2>
    
    <p>Kaplan was born in New Jersey but raised in La Ca√±ada Flintridge, California. Kaplan had been an avid video game player during his school
         years, particularly influenced by the various Infocom adventure games; however, lacking programming skills, he never thought he would be able
          to get a career in the video game industry. He initially pursued a degree in film, but ultimately got a degree in creative writing at the
           University of Southern California. After working as a writing intern for Universal Pictures, he decided to get a graduate degree for
            creative writing from New York University. Following this, he worked for his father's recruiting business while performing creative
             writing on the side to try to get his stories published. He had been unsuccessful of getting any of his creative stories published for
              several years, with having received over 170 rejection notices in a single year. By 2000, he decided to drop creative writing, and spent
               his time playing video games, as well as toying around with the level editors from games like Duke Nukem 3D and Half-Life. Later he got some jobs in the video    game
         industry. </p>
